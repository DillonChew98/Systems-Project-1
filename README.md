# Systems-Project-1
Work done in SIT Y1 trimester 3 using the LIMO training robot from agileX. Lane detection and following as well as a navigation package for ROS

### Lane Detection
Utilized computer vision techniques such as Canny Edge Detection and Hough Line Transform in openCV to perform line tracking and following functionalities

### Navigation 
Using the ROS navstack, performed SLAM (Simultaneous localization and Mapping) in a controlled environment. Parameters such as path distance bias, goal distance bias and occdist scale were all fine tuned to allow for navigation through tight spaces
